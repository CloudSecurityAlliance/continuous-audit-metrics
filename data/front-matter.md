## Context

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has launched an initiative to create a [continuous assessment framework for cloud security](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/continuous-audit-metrics/). As part of that work, CSA is building a **Continuous Audit Metrics Catalog** for the cloud to help organizations assess the security of information systems on a near-continuous basis. 

For a detailed description of the context, purpose and terminology used in this work, we refer the reader to sections 1, 2 and 3 of [version 1.0 of the continuous audit metrics catalog](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/the-continuous-audit-metrics-catalog/).
