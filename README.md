# Releases

An [v1.0 of the continuous audit metrics catalog](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/the-continuous-audit-metrics-catalog/) was released 10/19/2021. That document provides background on security metrics and continuous auditing, the use of metrics to increase the maturity of an organizations governance and risk management, a basic description of the metric format, and the initial catalog of 34 continous audit metrics addressing controls from the [CSA CCMv4](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/cloud-controls-matrix/).

# Ongoing work

To enage with this team please also join the [CSA Continuous Audit Metrics working group](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/continuous-audit-metrics/) for realtime discussions.

There are four tracks of work currently ongoing:
* The metric catalog (propose new metrics, update existing metrics)  
* Auditing Guidelines 
* Machine-readable translation of the metrics catalog (YAML) 
* Open source proof of concept tools to use the metrics, collect data, etc 

New metrics are discussed in working group meetings and github 'issues'.

The initial YAML file representation is close to completion and can be found in the /data directory. This will expanded as new metrics are agreed on / accepted by the working group. 

The auditing guidelines documentation is TBD. Discussion to be in working group meetings and github 'issues'. 

Open source tooling is being worked on in the [CAML](https://github.com/continube/CAML) repository.
