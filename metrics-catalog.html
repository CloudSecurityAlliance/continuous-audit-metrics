<h2>Context</h2>

<p>The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has launched an initiative to create a <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/continuous-audit-metrics/">continuous assessment framework for cloud security</a>. As part of that work, CSA is building a <strong>Continuous Audit Metrics Catalog</strong> for the cloud to help organizations assess the security of information systems on a near-continuous basis. </p>

<p>For a detailed description of the context, purpose and terminology used in this work, we refer the reader to sections 1, 2 and 3 of <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/the-continuous-audit-metrics-catalog/">version 1.0 of the continuous audit metrics catalog</a>.</p>

<p>There must be a Software Inventory of Deployed Production Code (DCS-06).  Production code must be quantified based on the definition of deployed code running in production (e.g. microservices, builds, releases, packages, libraries, serverless functions, etc.). This should be the same number used to measure AIS-07. The definition of <strong>deployed production code</strong> used for the software inventory should be aligned with application security scanning, testing, and/or reporting methods where possible to simplify measurement. The likelihood of standardized deployments can decrease as the number of different deployment systems increases. If the Software Deployment Pipeline has multiple stages where change could be introduced, and end-to-end validation cannot be performed, then the metric <strong>Percentage of steps in the Software Deployment Pipeline that have an associated verification step</strong> may be more suitable for an organization. There should be a mechanism to identify deviations, and if deviations from the standard are approved, then the system should account for (and manage) the exception as approved. This metric should at least be aligned with an organization's development or release cycle to provide timely input for correction in the next deployment or release. For example, if an organization uses an Agile development methodology with two-week sprints, then the metric should be measured at least every two weeks to provide data for review at sprint retros.</p>

<p>This metric requires the implementation of CCMv4 DCS-06 Asset Cataloging and Tracking and the capability to determine which assets or asset groups are deployed using change management technology that can rollback changes and/or stop deployment of risky changes based on automated test results. Given the dynamic nature of cloud environments, the metric can provide more value if the variations in the release management system's coverage over the population of assets is reported over time. The percentage of assets that fall within an accepted number of deviations provides stakeholders assurance of whether change control is getting better, worse, or being maintained. Larger populations of more than 1,000 assets can use 6 standard deviations as an acceptable level of change over time (i.e. Six Sigma). Smaller populations of assets will need to use less standard deviations as an acceptable level of change, perhaps even just 1 deviation. For more information on the use of standard deviation in security metrics, see this excerpt of Andrew Jaquith's Security Metrics book.</p>

<p>This metric assumes that CCC-03 has been successfully implemented and thus assumes that enough configuration items, at least in terms of number of CCMv4 DCS-06 assets, have change management technology to make this metric meaningful. This metric does not take into account a measure of risk for the configuration tests that have failed. The resulting flat percentage may not tell the full story of risk incurred from a control failure. Future work may incorporate risk measures such as high and critical configuration tests. The frequency of reporting this metric should tie in to the frequency of deployments/expected changes, minimally once a week. This metric should be measured on an automated, continuous basis. Since the scope is under the control of the organization, the metric results should be relatively high. The signal from this metric is that the existing system for change management is working or failing. A low percentage may not indicate a significant cybersecurity risk, but it may be a leading indicator of future security risk if the practice doesn't improve. This is different than IVS-04 which measures the number of hardening tests against all assets.</p>

<p>This relies on the security audit logs as defined in CCMv4 LOG-05 and the asset catalog defined in CCMv4 DCS-06. This assumes LOG-05 is inclusive of logs of a number of  events such as network traffic, network scanning, physical asset inventory. It assumes that the logs include network traffic logging, and logs from other assets, and  are sufficient to detect unexpected assets. We assume everything that is worthy is logged. This is a dependency on the auditor to ensure the logging is complete enough.  This is consistent with the metric for UEM-04. Implementers may benefit from the similarities. Any 3rd party CSPs used by the organization where shared responsibility of controls resides in the organization should be included as logical assets for this catalog. This is likely dependent on the maturity of STA-01 - STA-06 and the SSRM. For example if a CSP provides a microservice inherent in the operations of an offering that microservice is a logical asset. This ensures that metrics  where DCS numbers are used in the denominator include those micro-services. This is intended to ensure the coverage is accurate and inclusive of 3rd party CSPs where the  organization is responsible for the controls.</p>

The records could be as simple as entries in a spreadsheet or as complex as records for exception tracking in a GRC or vulnerability management system. This metric also requires organizations to define the threshold(s) for acceptable resolution time(s). The definition could be as simple as a statement in a policy document that applies to all exceptions, or individually-defined target dates for resolution of each exception based on risk. In the case of the latter, the requirements for setting the target resolution date(s) should be established in a policy and the target date(s) will need to be tracked in the policy exception records. For example if there is a ticketing system for remediation this tracks if the close date for the ticket was met. If an org has very few exceptions then slipping on even one will dramatically affect their percentage. This is inherent in statistics and is not seen as a problem for now.</p>

<p><em>Minutes</em> provides sufficient granularity to measure uptime up to a target of 5 9s. It should be noted though that the recommended frequency of evaluation is daily rather than yearly and therefore five nines score during any particular day can not be extrapolated as a yearly uptime. This reflects the objective of measuring and reporting on potential failures of the monitoring system for <em>immediate</em> notification at least daily. </p>

<p>To determine if a system is <em>up</em> a health check is expected. This metric does not mandate a specific healthcheck. Many uptime monitoring solutions exist that can be used as implementation examples or as services. A recommended level of health check is one that tests the functionality of the monitoring system during the minute of the test. For example a simple TCP/IP ping measures <em>uptime</em> but is insufficient to measure the availability of the functionality of a monitoring system. Testing that log entries are being persistently recorded during that minute is a more accurate measure of uptime availability. </p>

<p>The LOG-03 monitoring and alerting objective can reasonably be met by deploying multiple monitoring and alerting systems that are responsible for different areas of a complex environment. If multiple independent monitoring systems are deployed and only one fails a health check during any given minute is the system as a whole <em>up</em> or <em>down</em> during that minute? For the purpose of this metric, if any monitoring and alerting system fails a health check during a minute then the system as a whole is considered to be <em>down</em> during that minute. This is simplistic and easy and accurately captures the increased complexity of running multiple monitoring systems.</p>

<p>This simplification does not support considerations like, ""this subset monitoring and alerting system only covers a small number of low risk elements of the infrastructure."" Future versions of this metric may include <em>coverage</em> or <em>risk</em> elements to the metric expression.</p>

<p>A software component is a discrete unit of software, such as a library or package, with uniquely identifiable attributes such as would be supplied in a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). A simplistic approach is to track all software libraries and ensure they are in the inventory of approved libraries. One could track by using the vendor supplied SBOM or by scanning the software components directly. The implementer should have sufficient context in the STA-07 inventory to determine if a listed component library is approved, not-approved, or unknown (e.g. new and must be evaluated). A more granular approach is to use context to determine if the software should be running on this particular asset. For example: Bastion (jumphost) software or libraries may be approved for use on a hardened bastion asset but may not be appropriate for a non-hardened asset. The use of ""seen"" allows for sampling. There is nothing currently exposed in the metric to expose how statistically significant the sampling was. It is assumed that an initial audit confirmed significant sampling was used.</p>

<p><strong>To compute the denominator</strong> - The <em>Total Number of High and Critical Vulnerabilities</em> are any such vulnerabilities that are still open from previous periods plus all such newly identified during the current sample period.  A minimal example framework for vulnerability prioritization is CVSS v.3.0 where <em>High</em> and <em>Critical</em> are defined as 7.0 and above.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fetch all Critical or High vulnerabilities newly identified during the current period</li>
<li>Fetch all Critical or High vulnerabilities that are still Open (not Closed) from the previous period</li>

<p>For example, assume the following data sets for three example weekly periods...</p>

<p><em>Example period 1 is April 25 - May 01</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Number of Critical + High Vulnerabilities Created during the period = 10</li>

<li>Number of Critical + High Vulnerabilities Closed during the period within Policy = 8</li>
<li>Total Number of Critical + High Vulnerabilities Closed = 8</li>

</ul>

<p>Metric for the period 05/02-05/08 is Numerator = (g)/[(e) + (f)] = 14/(15+5) = 70%</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of Critical + High Vulnerabilities Created during the period = 5</li>
<li>Number of Critical + High Vulnerabilities still Open from previous periods <em>(as of the beginning of the current period-05/02)</em> = 0 (e+f-h)</li>

<p>To compute the NUMERATOR, determine the Total Number of Critical and High Vulnerabilities that have been identified for remediation per TVM-01 policies and procedures. In order to compute the metric, use the following logic in these rules.
For each Critical or High Vulnerability that were Identified during the period, or carried forward from the previous period...
a) Check the Vulnerability Publish Date. Is this date &lt; the date on which the Asset was commissioned. If so, use the Asset Commission Date as the <em>from date</em>. If not, then use the Vulnerability Publish Date as the <em>from date</em>.
b) Subtract the Vulnerability Identification Date from the <em>from date</em>. The Identification Date is the date that your organization has acknowledged the vulnerability to be acted upon (e.g. this may be a the ticket create date on Jira for the given vulnerability)
c) Evaluate if b &gt; the policy duration (in days). If so, add +1 to the count.</p>

<p>To compute the DENOMINATOR, The <em>Total Number of High and Critical Vulnerabilities</em> are...
a) Opened during the current period and/or
b) Carried over from the previous period because the policy timeframe spans period. For example, let us say that we measure the control on a weekly basis from Sunday - Saturday and the policy timeframe is 3 days. Any issue identified on or after Thursday is not due, per policy, until the following period. These vulnerabilities are <em>carried over</em> into the following period.</p>
